## Vite + React.js + Tailwind CSS

Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

## How To Start :

    ### Install Vite and create React project:

    Execute [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

    ```bash
    npm init vite@latest
    # or
    yarn create vite
    ```
    Then follow the prompts and make your choices.
    Now execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd my-project

    npm install
    ```

    ### Install and setup Tailwind CSS:
    To install [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss) and its peer dependencies via `npm`, and create your `tailwind.config.js` file, execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init
    ```

    ### Add Tailwind to your PostCSS configuration
    Add `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` to your `postcss.config.js` file, or wherever PostCSS is configured in your project.

    ```bash
    module.exports = {
    plugins: {
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
    }
    }
    ```

    ### Configure your Template paths
    Add the paths to all of your template files in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

    ```bash
    module.exports = {
    content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
    }
    ```

    ### Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS
    Add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main CSS `main.css` file.

    ```bash
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

    ### Now finally run your Project:
    Run your build process with `npm run dev`or whatever command is configured in your `package.json` file.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
